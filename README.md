### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently keeping myself busy with...
  - a Job, which by the way, leaves little time for all the other points...
  - Udacity Cloud Developer Nanodegree...two more projects and I can absolve it
  - AWS Machine Learning Foundations as a prereq. for a Nano Degree Program
  - [animating Git](https://github.com/vladflore/git-animated)
  - a Manning Live Project
  - my [Blog](https://vladflore.tech/)
  - a midsize Java/Spring/Angular web app (see Blog)
  - PRs for an [OS project](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) written in Julia, JavaScript, HTML and CSS

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning/brushing up on:
  - Kotlin
  - Java 11+
  - Cloud (AWS)
  - Python
  - ML
  - Clean Code
  - Spring(Boot)
  - [Julia](https://julialang.org/)

Besides all that, I like dipping my toes into all sorts of Computer Science / Software Engineering related subjects: computational thinking, competitive-ish programming, data science, machine learning, documenting projects, CI/CD and co.

- Some JS/HTML/CSS projects to brush up on "vanilla" frontend development:
  - [Game Of Life](https://vladflore.github.io/game-of-life/)
  - [Light Dark Mode](https://vladflore.github.io/light-dark-mode/)

  - [Infinity Scroll](https://vladflore.github.io/infinity-scroll/)
  - [Quote Generator](https://vladflore.github.io/quote-generator/)

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on interesting projects related to Software Engineering, in general and Web Development, in particular

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ... nothing in particular

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: I'm a man biologically and otherwise, so use those you learned in school

- âš¡ Fun fact: as I am living in Germany, my first name, Vlad, has been pronounced and written in all sorts of ways, like: Flat, Flad or Wlad. The story continues, as I have heard my name pronounced Blad(maybe with a softer B) by a Spanish guy. Looking forward to adding more to this list... :)
