### Hi there ðŸ‘‹



- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
- - my [Blog](https://vladflore.tech/)
- - a JetBrains Academy project (see pinned repositories for other completed projects)
- - a midsize Java/Spring/Angular web app (see Blog)

- Some of the JS/HTML/CSS projects:
- - [Game Of Life](https://vladflore.github.io/game-of-life/)
- - [Light Dark Mode](https://vladflore.github.io/light-dark-mode/)
- - [Picture in Picture](https://vladflore.github.io/picture-in-picture/)
- - [Infinity Scroll](https://vladflore.github.io/infinity-scroll/)
- - [Quote Generator](https://vladflore.github.io/quote-generator/)

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning/brushing up on Algorithms & Data Structures, Cloud (AWS), [Julia](https://julialang.org/), JavaScript, Java 11+, Spring(Boot), Design Patterns; additionally I enjoy wrestling with coding challenges, and because Advent is coming, [AoC](https://adventofcode.com/) seems like a good challenge

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on interesting projects related to Software Engineering and Web Development with Java, Spring, Angular and co.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ... nothing in particular

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Software Development / Engineering in general and Java, Spring in particular

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: I'm a man biologically and otherwise, so use those you learned in school

- âš¡ Fun fact: as I am living in Germany, my first name, Vlad, has been pronounced and written in all sorts of ways, like: Flat, Flad, Wlad. The story continues, as I have heard my name pronounced Blad(maybe with a softer B) by a Spanish guy...oh well...
